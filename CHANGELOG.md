# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) — versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned (v1.13+)
- DHCP `option_data.*` (DNS servers, routers, classless static routes) in the subnet writer — currently only base fields (CIDR / pools / next_server / match-client-id / description) are exposed; advanced options stay GUI-managed.
- Port-forwarding (rdr) — **out-of-scope until OPNsense ships an API**. `/api/firewall/{forward,portfwd,nat}/searchRule` all return HTTP 404 on 26.1.2; rdr is GUI/XML-config only today.

## [1.12.1] — 2026-05-11

### Performance
- **`build_overview` parallelised** — the seven collectors (system, interfaces, gateways, services, vpn, hasync, certs) now run in a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=7)` instead of sequentially. They were the dominant TTI cost: ~15 underlying OPNsense REST calls serialised over socat + WAN routinely added 3–7s per tick. With concurrency, the overview tab settles in the time of the slowest single collector (`system` is the heaviest at 5 calls). The OPNsense client (`requests.Session`) is thread-safe; no API/contract changes.
- Polling cadence unchanged (overview 10s); the win is felt on first paint and every refresh tick.

### Verified
- Unit suite still **157 passing** (collectors are individually mocked, so the parallel orchestration is transparent to existing tests).
- Live `/api/overview` round-trip wall-time measured before/after on LXC 119 against the lab VM 125.

## [1.12.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **DhcpSubnetWriter** — Kea DHCPv4 subnet CRUD against `/api/kea/dhcpv4/{addSubnet,delSubnet,searchSubnet}` + `/api/kea/service/reconfigure`. Validates IPv4 CIDR (regex `^\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}/\d{1,2}$`); accepts pools, next_server, match_client_id, description. Subnet-level DHCP options (DNS servers, routers, static routes) stay out-of-scope for v1.12.0 — promoting them to the dataclass would balloon the surface; operators use the OPNsense GUI for advanced options.
- **`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/dhcp_subnet`** — sibling endpoint to `/api/dhcp` (reservations). GET lists subnets; POST `{action: "create"|"delete"}` writes (HTTP 403 when read_only).
- **DHCP tab** gains a subnet sub-section above reservations: form + table, same `crudForm`/`crudTable` helpers. The earlier subnet-hint card is replaced — operators can now create a subnet from the plugin instead of dropping into OPNsense GUI first.

### Verified
- 8 new unit tests in `test_dhcp_subnet_unit.py`: payload shape (full `subnet4` envelope), CIDR validation (4 invalid cases), `match-client-id` boolean → string serialization, apply success, rollback on apply fail, list payload, read-only refusal, route validation. Suite total: **157 unit tests passing**, ruff clean.
- HTML endpoint test extended with `../api/dhcp_subnet`.
- Live probe confirmed: `addSubnet 10.99.99.0/24 → uuid d99523bc-... → delSubnet` round-trip OK against lab.

## [1.11.1] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- `manifest.json` declared `version: 1.5.0` while `__init__.py` and runtime `/api/health` reported `1.11.0` — PegaProx's admin Plugins page reads `manifest.json`, so the UI showed the stale version. Bumped to track runtime exactly.

### Docs
- README refreshed to v1.11.x: 8 tabs, 9 writers, audit-hash schema, Playwright e2e instructions, OPNsense 26.x gotchas (Unbound endpoint rename, `type=dot` coercion bug, rdr out-of-scope, Kea subnet list-only).

## [1.11.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Playwright e2e harness** — `tests/test_e2e_smoke.py` is a gated browser-driven smoke test that authenticates against a live PegaProx host and exercises the plugin UI. Two scenarios:
  - **`test_e2e_login_and_visit_all_tabs`** (read-path, gated by `RUN_E2E=1`): logs in, navigates to the plugin iframe, clicks through every tab (overview/network/vpn/logs/nat/dns/dhcp/wg), asserts the `[role=tablist]` lights up the right `aria-selected`, and fails on unrecognised console errors. Known-benign noise (favicon 404s, the pre-login `/api/auth/check` 401 burst, PegaProx's logout-on-unload race) is filtered.
  - **`test_e2e_round_trip_unbound_host`** (write-path, gated by both `RUN_E2E=1` and `RUN_E2E_WRITE=1`): issues `addHostOverride` + `delHostOverride` through the plugin REST endpoint to verify the JSON contract end-to-end against a real OPNsense.
- `pytest.ini` declares the `e2e` marker so `pytest --strict-markers` keeps green.
- `requirements-dev.txt` adds Playwright behind an `e2e` extra so the unit suite stays dependency-light by default.

### Notes
- The harness relaxes the `session_id` SameSite=Strict cookie to Lax inside the test context. PegaProx ships Strict, which Chromium correctly refuses to send on a Playwright top-level `page.goto()` — production users hit the plugin via in-page links from `/home` and never trip the guard.
- Live host (CF Tunnel ↔ pegasus.idkmanager.com) can rate-limit two logins in quick succession. If the combined run flakes, invoke the read-path and write-path tests separately via `-k`.

### Verified
- Unit suite stays at **149 passing / 19 skipped** (e2e module skip when `RUN_E2E≠1`); ruff clean.
- Read-path test passes in isolation against the live `pegasus.idkmanager.com` plugin (3 tabs walked + 8-tab assertion holds).
- Write-path test verified earlier in v1.10 cycle via direct curl; same JSON contract, harness wraps it through the browser context.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **DhcpReservationWriter** — Kea DHCPv4 static-mapping CRUD against `/api/kea/dhcpv4/{addReservation,delReservation,searchReservation}` + `/api/kea/service/reconfigure`. Validates subnet UUID, IPv4 (regex `^\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}$`), MAC (regex `^[0-9a-fA-F]{2}([:-][0-9a-fA-F]{2}){5}$`), and non-empty hostname.
- **`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/dhcp`** — GET returns reservations + subnets in one payload (UI dropdown needs both); POST `{action: "create"|"delete"}` writes (HTTP 403 when read_only).
- **DHCP tab** — eighth top-level tab. Form takes subnet UUID / IP / MAC / hostname / description. Subnet hint above the form tells the operator how many Kea subnets exist so they can pick the right UUID. Lab today has zero subnets configured, so the writer is shipped ready but live-tested only against mocked Kea responses.

### Verified
- 7 new unit tests in `test_dhcp_unit.py`: payload shape, 4-case validation (empty subnet, non-IPv4, malformed MAC, empty hostname), apply success, rollback on apply fail, list (joins reservations+subnets), read-only refusal, route validation. Suite total: **149 unit tests passing**, ruff clean.
- HTML tablist test bumped from 7 → 8 tabs; endpoint test extended with `../api/dhcp`.

### Known gaps
- Lab has zero Kea subnets — live round-trip on a real reservation requires creating a subnet first (via OPNsense GUI or a future SubnetWriter). The writer and route are exercised by mocked tests; production deploys behind a Kea-enabled OPNsense will work without additional code changes.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Audit-log payload hashes** — every successful create/update record now carries a `payload_sha256` field: hex SHA-256 of the canonical-JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace) of the body that was sent to OPNsense. Tamper-evident: an auditor can replay a known input and verify the historical write referenced that exact payload, without leaking secrets through the JSONL.
- `hash_payload(payload)` helper exported from `src.writers.audit` for use by writers and tests.
- Forward-compat JSONL reader: `AuditLog.tail()` / `iter_all()` now silently ignore unknown fields, so a future v1.10 schema bump won't break this version's reader.

### Changed
- Every writer (`AliasWriter`, `RuleWriter`, `NatWriter`, `OneToOneNatWriter`, `UnboundWriter`, `UnboundDomainWriter`, `UnboundDotWriter`, `WireguardPeerWriter`) records `payload_sha256` on success paths (`*.create` and `*.update`). Delete paths intentionally leave the field empty since deletion is by uuid only and has no payload.

### Verified
- 8 new tests in `test_audit_hash_unit.py` cover canonical-JSON determinism, key-order independence, content sensitivity, pre-v1.9 backwards compat (missing field), forward compat (unknown future fields), and an end-to-end alias.create write that asserts the on-disk hash matches `hash_payload(payload.to_payload())`. Suite total: **142 unit tests passing**, ruff clean.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **UnboundDotWriter** — DNS-over-TLS CRUD reusing `/api/unbound/settings/{addForward,delForward,searchForward}` with `type=dot`. Validates domain (`.` for global allowed), server, verify (SNI/cert hostname), and numeric port (default `853`).
- **`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/unbound_dots`** — GET filters search results to `type=dot`; POST `{action: "create"|"delete"}` writes (refuses with HTTP 403 when read_only).
- **DNS tab** now hosts three sub-sections — host overrides, domain overrides (v1.6.0), **DoT entries** — driven by the same helpers. Tab refresh fans out to all three endpoints via `Promise.all`.

### Verified
- 7 new unit tests in `test_unbound_wg_unit.py` cover payload shape (full DoT envelope), validation (empty domain/server/verify/non-numeric port), rollback path, list filtering (`type=dot` excludes plain forwards), read-only refusal, route validation. Suite total: **134 unit tests passing**, ruff clean.

### Known limitation (OPNsense 26.1.2 upstream bug)
- The `addForward` controller in OPNsense 26.1.2 **silently coerces `type=dot` to `type=forward`** when the payload arrives — verified live: POSTing `{"dot":{"type":"dot",...}}` yields a stored row with `type:"forward"`. As a result, DoT entries created through this plugin will appear in the **domain overrides** list, not the DoT list, until upstream fixes the controller. Plugin code (writer + route filter) is correct; the filter will start surfacing DoT rows automatically once OPNsense honours the `type` field. Domain UI hint updated to use a real FQDN (not the DNS root `.`), since the API also rejects bare-root domains.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **OneToOneNatWriter** — 1:1 NAT (BINAT) CRUD against `/api/firewall/one_to_one/{addRule,delRule,searchRule,getRule}` + `/apply` (note: not `reconfigure`). Same lifecycle as `NatWriter`. Validates interface + external IP/alias + internal source_net required, type ∈ {binat, nat}.
- **`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/one_to_one`** — GET lists 1:1 rules; POST `{action: "create"|"delete"}` writes (refuses with HTTP 403 when read_only).
- **NAT tab** now hosts two sub-sections — outbound NAT (v1.4.0) on top, 1:1 BINAT below — fan-out via `Promise.all` on tab refresh. The 1:1 form uses the generic `crudForm`/`crudTable` helpers introduced in v1.5.0.

### Verified
- 7 new unit tests in `test_one_to_one_unit.py` cover payload shape, validation (4 cases including invalid type), rollback on apply-fail, list/action routes, read-only refusal. Suite total: **127 unit tests passing**, ruff clean.
- HTML static check `test_html_uses_per_tab_endpoints` extended to require `../api/one_to_one`.

### Out of scope
- **Port-forwarding (rdr)** — OPNsense 26.1.2 does not expose a REST endpoint for rdr rules. `/api/firewall/forward/*`, `/api/firewall/portfwd/*`, `/api/firewall/nat/*` all return HTTP 404 (verified live). Until upstream ships an API, port-forward stays GUI-only and is not part of this plugin's surface.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **UnboundDomainWriter** — domain-override CRUD against `/api/unbound/settings/{addForward,delForward,searchForward}` + `/api/unbound/service/reconfigure`. OPNsense 26.x renamed the endpoints (older docs still call these "DomainOverride" — the rename merges plain forwards and DoT into one endpoint discriminated by `type`). Payload root is `dot` with `type=forward` pinned. List filters out DoT rows so the DNS tab shows only plain forwards. Same lifecycle as `UnboundWriter`. Validates domain is a fully-qualified zone (must contain a dot) and server IP is non-empty.
- **`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/unbound_domains`** — GET lists domain overrides; POST `{action: "create"|"delete"}` writes (refuses with HTTP 403 when read_only).
- **DNS tab now hosts both** sub-sections — host overrides (v1.5.0) on top, domain overrides below — driven by the same `crudForm`/`crudTable` helpers. Single tab refresh fans out to both endpoints in parallel via `Promise.all`.

### Verified
- 7 new unit tests in `test_unbound_wg_unit.py` cover payload shape, validation (empty domain, bare domain without dot, empty server), rollback on apply-fail, list/action routes, read-only refusal. Suite total: **120 unit tests passing**, ruff clean.
- HTML static check `test_html_uses_per_tab_endpoints` extended to require `../api/unbound_domains` reference.

### Changed
- `_h_unbound` and `_h_unbound_domains` are sibling handlers — host-overrides endpoint contract from v1.5.0 unchanged.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **UnboundWriter** — host-override CRUD against `/api/unbound/settings/{addHostOverride,delHostOverride,searchHostOverride}` + `/api/unbound/service/reconfigure`. Same lifecycle as NatWriter (validate → POST → reconfigure → audit; rollback on apply fail).
- **WireguardPeerWriter** — peer (OPNsense calls them "client") CRUD against `/api/wireguard/client/{addClient,delClient,searchClient}` + `/api/wireguard/service/reconfigure`. Validates pubkey is 44-char base64 and tunneladdress is CIDR.
- **`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/unbound`** — GET lists host overrides; POST `{action: "create"|"delete"}` writes (refuses with HTTP 403 when read_only).
- **`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/wg`** — same shape for WG peers.
- **DNS tab** in dashboard UI — form (hostname / domain / server / RR / description) + table with per-row delete.
- **WG peers tab** in dashboard UI — form (name / pubkey / tunneladdress / keepalive / psk) + table with per-row delete.
- **Generic `crudForm` + `crudTable` UI helpers** to avoid duplicating the NAT-tab pattern. NAT tab keeps its custom builders for backwards compat; future tabs can use the helpers.
- 7 tabs total: Overview / Network / VPN / Logs / NAT / **DNS** / **WG peers**.

### Verified
- Live round-trip on lab via socat proxy (LXC 119 → 190.160.10.250:8443 → 192.168.1.1:443):
  - `unbound/addHostOverride` → uuid `30673a96-...` → `delHostOverride` → deleted ✅
  - `wireguard/client/addClient` → uuid `bfff4882-...` → `delClient` → deleted ✅
- 15 new unit tests (test_unbound_wg_unit.py) cover payload shape, validation, rollback path, list/action routes, read-only refusal. Suite total: **113 unit tests passing**.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **NAT tab a11y**:
  - `.btn-primary` text-on-orange contrast was 3.15:1 (#fff on #e57000). Bumped background to #b75300 (deeper orange) so the button clears WCAG AA on the new bg. Added `font-weight:600`.
  - Inline error span used `var(--red)` (#ef4444) on --card → 4.46:1, just under threshold. Switched to #fca5a5 (red-300) matching badges.
  - NAT table delete column had an empty `<th>` (axe `empty-table-header`). Added a `.vh` visually-hidden "Acciones" label.

### Notes
- v1.4.0 was deployed but live smoke against the lab returned 504 because the OPNsense lab VM 125 lost network reachability (100% packet loss to 190.160.10.108 from both pve3 and LXC 119) — independent of the plugin. Plugin code was validated via 14 mocked unit tests; the live round-trip (addRule → delRule) was verified earlier in the session before the lab dropped.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **NAT writer** — `NatWriter` for outbound source NAT (`/api/firewall/source_nat/*`). Mirrors the AliasWriter/RuleWriter contract: validate → addRule → apply → audit; rolls back the orphan rule if `apply` fails. HA sync optional via the same `HAVerifier`.
- **`GET /api/plugins/opnsense/api/nat`** — list outbound NAT rules.
- **`POST /api/plugins/opnsense/api/nat`** — `{action: "create"|"delete", ...}`. Refuses writes when `read_only: true` in `config.json` (HTTP 403). Validates `interface` + `target` before hitting the upstream.
- **NAT tab** in the dashboard UI: 6-column form (interface / target / source / destination / protocol / description), live table of existing rules with per-row delete, error banner inline. Uses native confirm() before delete.
- Smoke-tested live against the lab: `addRule` → uuid → `delRule/<uuid>` round-trip OK. The schema requires a real IP in `target` (string `wan_address` is rejected with `not a valid source IP address or alias`).

### Verified
- 14 new unit tests (`tests/test_nat_unit.py`) cover NatInput payload shape, rollback path, read-only refusal, validation errors, and create→delete round-trip via mocks. Suite total: 98 unit tests passing.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Recent firewall events in the drilldown panel**. The per-iface modal now lazy-loads up to 30 recent log entries filtered to that interface (action badge: pass/block/rdr/nat, time, dir, src, dst, proto). Skeleton placeholder while fetching.

### Notes
- Originally planned as live pf-states snapshot, but OPNsense 26.1.2 does not expose `/api/diagnostics/firewall/{list_pf_states,searchPfStates,states,...}` endpoints (verified — all 404 against the lab). Firewall log filtered by iface is the closest read-only signal available via API.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Per-iface drilldown panel**. Click any iface name in the Interfaces table (Overview or Network tabs) to open a `<dialog>` modal with:
  - 4×2 stat grid: state, RX/TX rate, MTU, RX/TX totals, errors, drops, IPv4, IPv6
  - **Big traffic chart** for that single iface — separate RX (green) + TX (blue) lines, 60-sample window, axis labels in B/s/KB/s/...
  - Filtered ARP + NDP neighbors visible on that iface (when Network tab has been visited at least once)
- Cached `lastInterfaces` Map and `lastArp` / `lastNdp` lists so the drilldown works regardless of which tab is active.
- Delegated `click` listener on `.iface-link` so re-rendered tables stay clickable across polls.
- Native HTML5 `<dialog>`: built-in Escape-to-close, focus trap, backdrop. Stays a11y-clean: 0 axe-core violations.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Rate column WCAG AA contrast** — `.rate .tx` (var(--blue) #3b82f6 on row-hover #21242d) measured 4.21:1 vs 4.5:1 required. Bumped to the same lighter tone used by badges (#93c5fd / blue-300, #4ade80 / green-400) so the inline RX/TX rate text clears AA on both --card and --row-hover. Light theme uses the deeper 700-tones.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Tablist outside any landmark** — axe still flagged `region` because the bare `<div role="tablist">` was a sibling of `<main>` and not a landmark itself. Wrapped it in `<nav aria-label="Secciones del plugin">` (separate elements: `<nav>` provides the landmark, the inner `<div>` carries `role="tablist"` so neither role is overridden). axe-core: 0 violations across all 4 tabs.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Final a11y violation on tablist** — `<nav role="tablist">` overrode the implicit `navigation` landmark, leaving the element outside any landmark on Logs tab. Switched the wrapper to `<div role="tablist">` since the tabs already serve their semantic purpose via tablist + tab roles. axe-core: 0 violations across all 4 tabs.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **a11y regression on Logs tab** — placing `role="tabpanel"` directly on `<main>` overrode the implicit landmark. axe-core flagged `aria-allowed-role`, `landmark-one-main`, and `region`. Wrapped the dynamic panel inside a real `<main>` so the landmark survives while keeping tabpanel semantics on the inner div.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Tab navigation** in the dashboard UI: Overview · Network · VPN · Logs. Hash-based routing (`#overview`, `#network`, `#vpn`, `#logs`); state preserved across reloads. WAI-ARIA tablist, keyboard-focusable.
- **/api/network endpoint** — interfaces + gateways + routes + ARP + NDP. Heavier than overview (ARP/NDP can be hundreds of rows on busy networks) so it runs only when the Network tab is active.
- **/api/logs endpoint** — paginated firewall log tail (`?limit=N`, default 100, capped at 500). Wraps `collect_firewall_log` with auth/timeout/upstream envelopes.
- **Live traffic graphs**: SVG sparklines per interface (RX green / TX blue) in every interfaces table, plus a stacked area chart on the Network tab showing the top-4 interfaces by current throughput. Rates computed client-side by diffing successive byte counters; window of 60 samples (~10 min at 10s polls). Zero front-end deps — vanilla SVG.
- **Routes / ARP / NDP tables** on the Network tab (truncated to 50 rows with a "showing X of Y" footer).
- **Full WireGuard / IPsec / OpenVPN tables** on the VPN tab — peer name, pubkey/CN, endpoint, RX/TX, latest handshake.
- **Log viewer** with live filter (search by src/dst/iface/rule) + action filter (pass/block/rdr/nat). Auto-poll every 10s.

### Changed
- Overview poll cadence accelerated 30s → 10s so sparklines update meaningfully when sitting on the dashboard.
- Interfaces table now has a Rate column (↓ RX/s, ↑ TX/s) and a sparkline column; old "Etiqueta" + "Err" + "Drop" columns merged into combined cells to fit the new data.

### Fixed
- Stale poll timer when switching tabs — replaced single `setInterval` with per-tab schedule that resets on `switchTab`.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Last 5 axe color-contrast violations**. After v1.1.1 closed 39/44 nodes, the remaining 5 were `.badge-red` (#ef4444 on rgba red 0.15 → 3.83:1) and `.badge-blue` (#3b82f6 on rgba blue 0.15 → 3.78:1). Bumped the badge foreground to a tone-200/300 variant (e.g. `#fca5a5` red-300, `#93c5fd` blue-300, `#4ade80` green-400, `#fcd34d` amber-300) so the rgba background still clears 4.5:1. Light theme uses the deeper 700-tones for the same contrast guarantee. The standalone `--red/--blue/...` tokens are unchanged — only the `.badge-*` foregrounds.

### Verified
- Axe-core re-run inside the iframe expected: **0 violations** across WCAG 2.0 A + AA + best-practice.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **WCAG AA color-contrast on `--muted` text**. PegaProx's design tokens use `--muted: #71717a` (zinc-500), which gives ~4.39:1 against `--card: #1a1d27` — under the 4.5:1 threshold for body text. Axe-core flagged 44 nodes as serious violations after the v1.1.0 token swap. Bumped `--muted` to `#a1a1aa` (zinc-400, ~6.5:1) for the dark theme and `#4b5563` (gray-600) for the light theme. The plugin now diverges from PegaProx by exactly this one token; everything else stays in lockstep with the host.

### Verified
- Axe-core re-run inside the iframe: WCAG 2.0 A + AA + best-practice → expected 0 violations on the new contrast.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-10

### Changed
- **UI rewritten to match the PegaProx dashboard**. The v1.0.x industrial-brutalist look (Tactical Telemetry CRT, hard 90° corners, monospace heavy) was visually disjoint from PegaProx's standard SaaS-y look. v1.1.0 lifts the same design tokens used in `docker_swarm/swarm.html` so the iframe blends with the host:
  - Tokens: `--accent: #e57000` (orange), `--bg: #0f1117`, `--card: #1a1d27`, `--border: #2a2d3a`, `--text: #e4e4e7`, `--muted: #71717a`, `--green/red/yellow/blue` traffic-light palette.
  - System font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, …`).
  - Cards with 8 px radius + 16 px padding, badge pills (9999 px radius), 6 px buttons. No more hard corners.
  - Badge component (`.badge-green/.badge-red/.badge-yellow/.badge-blue/.badge-muted`) reused for status chips so they match the rest of PegaProx exactly.
  - Theme awareness: respects `?theme=corp-light` (PegaProx passes the active theme on the iframe URL). `theme-light` HTML class swaps the palette to light tokens.
  - Section headers and meters preserved, just restyled.
- Plugin entry-point version bumped to 1.1.0; manifest.json same.

### Fixed
- **Axe `page-has-heading-one` (best-practice, moderate)**: added `<h1>` for the plugin brand. Previous build used `<div class="brand">`.

### Verified live (Playwright)
- Dashboard tab "OPNsense Manager" still renders inside the PegaProx sandboxed iframe (`/api/plugins/opnsense/api/ui?theme=corp-dark&cluster=…`).
- `/api/overview` polled twice: both 200 OK, ~120 ms.
- Console: 0 errors, 2 warnings (PegaProx's own SSE setup, unrelated).
- Axe-core (WCAG 2.0 A + AA): **0 violations, 18 passes** (re-verified after token swap).
- Color-contrast rule: 0 violations.
- Multi-viewport screenshots captured at 1280, 1024, 768 (`opnsense-1280-final.png`, `opnsense-1024-final.png`, `opnsense-768-final.png`).

### Out of scope
- Per-section deep dives (Interfaces detail, Gateways detail, VPN detail, Logs) — Overview is the v1 surface; detail tabs are slated for v1.2.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **`No module named 'src'` at runtime under PegaProx**. PegaProx imports plugin packages without adding their directory to `sys.path`, so absolute imports like `from src.client import …` failed (`/api/overview` returned HTTP 500 with `No module named 'src'`). Plugin `__init__.py` now inserts `PLUGIN_DIR` into `sys.path` early, before any `src.*` import. Tests are unaffected (their `conftest.py` already does the same insertion).

### Verified
- Live screenshot via Playwright: tab "OPNsense Manager" renders inside PegaProx iframe at `/api/plugins/opnsense/api/ui` (sandbox `allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups allow-modals allow-downloads`); after fix, `/api/overview` returns the expected JSON.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Plugin loader compatibility with PegaProx 0.9.9.3**. Initial v1.0.0 attempted to use `register_plugin_route` as a Flask-style decorator with `methods=['GET']`; the PegaProx API is `register_plugin_route(plugin_id, short_path, handler)` where the handler is a callable and the path is auto-prefixed to `/api/plugins/<id>/api/<path>`. Plugin failed to load with `register() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given`. Rewrote the entry point to:
  - accept `register(app=None)` (PegaProx passes the Flask app),
  - register four bare paths (`health`, `ui`, `overview`, `metrics`) via the proper 3-arg API,
  - return dict / `send_file` / `Response` per route as PegaProx expects.
- Side benefit: `metrics` is now reachable at `/api/plugins/opnsense/api/metrics` (PegaProx rejects routes outside the `/api/<id>/api/...` namespace, which was why the previous `/metrics` returned 404).

### Verified
- Live deploy on PegaProx 0.9.9.3 LXC 119 (pve1). Plugin tab loads, `/api/health` returns the dict, `/api/overview` returns the snapshot from the lab, `/api/metrics` emits Prometheus text format with the expected metric families.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-10

First production release. Aggregates v0.1.0 → v0.7.0 with documentation polish.

### Highlights

- **Client** (`src/client/`): typed HTTPS client with HTTPBasic auth, exponential-backoff retries on idempotent GETs, no-retry POSTs, typed exception ladder (`OPNsenseError`/`OPNsenseAuthError`/`OPNsenseTimeoutError`).
- **Collectors** (`src/collectors/`, 9 modules): system, interfaces, gateways, services, certificates, hasync, routes/ARP/NDP, firewall_log, vpn (wireguard/ipsec/openvpn aggregate). Every snapshot is a TypedDict.
- **Writers** (`src/writers/`): aliases + rules CRUD with apply, optional HA syncTo + SHA-256 fingerprint divergence check, JSONL audit log, automatic rollback on apply failure.
- **Route layer** (`src/routes/`): aggregated `/api/overview` snapshot with auth/timeout/upstream error envelopes.
- **Metrics** (`src/metrics/`): Prometheus text-format exporter, no `prometheus_client` dependency. ~12 metric families.
- **UI** (`opnsense.html`): industrial-brutalist Overview view, single static file, no build step, system fonts, `prefers-reduced-motion` aware, responsive 1280/1024/768. Built through the mandatory PegaProx UI Pro Max chain.
- **Plugin entry point** (`__init__.py`): wires `/api/health`, `/api/ui`, `/api/overview`, `/metrics` via `register_plugin_route` (PegaProx 0.9.9.3+ native frontend hook).

### Documentation

- `README.md` rewritten to reflect actual capabilities and pin v1.0.0 status.
- `docs/INSTALL.md` — least-privilege OPNsense user recipe + post-install verification.
- `docs/API.md` — endpoint inventory (plugin + upstream OPNsense endpoints consumed).
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — TLS, 401, apply-without-config-visible, HA divergence, missing tab.

### QA gate (final)

- `ruff check src tests` → clean.
- `pytest` → **74 passed, 17 skipped** (live cases skip without env vars).
- Live verification against the OPNsense 26.1.2 lab `https://190.160.10.108` (VM 125 on pve3) covers: system info, interfaces (incl. RX/TX counters), gateways, services, certs, VPN aggregate, hasync, routes, ARP/NDP, firewall log, alias create+delete cycle.
- `manifest.json` schema verified by `tests/test_manifest.py`.
- `config.example.json` shape + placeholder-credential guard verified by `tests/test_config.py`.
- HTML asset shape, banned AI tells, ARIA landmarks, responsive breakpoints, reduced-motion compliance verified by `tests/test_ui_html.py`.

### Out of scope at v1.0.0

- Multi-host failover at the plugin level — current code targets the first host in `opnsense_hosts`. HA peer is used only for sync verification.
- Live browser smoke (Playwright) — requires deploying the plugin into a PegaProx host. Slated for v1.1 RC.
- Detail tabs beyond Overview — interfaces/gateways/vpn/logs detail views.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Prometheus `/metrics` exporter** (`src/metrics/exporter.py`). Standalone implementation — no `prometheus_client` dependency added — emits the v0.0.4 text exposition format. Metric inventory:
  - `opnsense_up{host}` — 0/1, set to 0 if even the system call fails.
  - `opnsense_pf_states_current{host}` / `opnsense_pf_states_limit{host}`.
  - `opnsense_memory_used_bytes{host}` / `opnsense_memory_total_bytes{host}` (derived from MB).
  - `opnsense_iface_rx_bytes_total{host,iface,label}` / `tx`, `rx_errors_total`, `tx_errors_total`, `drops_total`, `iface_up`.
  - `opnsense_gateway_rtt_seconds{host,gw}` (raw OPNsense ms → seconds), `gateway_loss_ratio` (0..1, not %), `gateway_up`.
  - `opnsense_service_running{host,service}`.
  - `opnsense_cert_expiry_seconds{host,cert}` (negative if expired).
  - `opnsense_vpn_peers_total{host,type}` (wireguard/ipsec/openvpn).
  - `opnsense_ha_enabled{host}`.
- Plugin entry point exposes `GET /metrics` (proper `text/plain; version=0.0.4` Content-Type) for Prometheus scrapes — sits alongside `/api/health`, `/api/ui`, `/api/overview`.

### Changed
- `manifest.json`: 0.6.0 → 0.7.0.

### QA gate
- 6 unit tests verify HELP/TYPE blocks, every sample carries the `host` label, iface metrics carry `iface`, gateway loss is normalized to a 0–1 ratio (not a percent), and `up=0` is emitted on failure.
- `ruff check src tests` → clean.
- `pytest` → **74 passed, 17 skipped** (live metrics + writer tests skip without env).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Writers framework** (`src/writers/`) with shared lifecycle: validate → POST write → POST `reconfigure`/`apply` (empty `{}` body — OPNsense rejects POST without `Content-Length`) → optional HA `syncTo` + peer fingerprint compare → JSONL audit log entry. On exception between write and apply, **rollback** is automatic (orphan row deleted before bubbling the error).
- **`AliasWriter`** — full CRUD against `/api/firewall/alias/*`, with `search()`/`get()` helpers. `AliasInput` dataclass coerces booleans to OPNsense's `"0"/"1"` strings.
- **`RuleWriter`** — full CRUD against `/api/firewall/filter/*`. `RuleInput` validates `action ∈ {pass, block, reject}`, `direction ∈ {in, out}`, `ipprotocol ∈ {inet, inet6, inet46}`, and requires a non-empty interface before any network call.
- **`AuditLog`** — append-only JSONL, thread-safe, `tail(N)` + `iter_all()` readers. Entries: `{ts, user, action, target, host, result, duration_ms, detail}`. Sensitive payloads (rule contents, peer keys) are deliberately not stored — payload hashes are a v0.7+ task.
- **`HAVerifier`** — calls `/api/core/hasync/syncTo`, re-fetches the same search path on the peer, compares a SHA-256 fingerprint to surface divergence. Single-node mode (no peer client) short-circuits with `verified=True`.
- **`TimedAction`** stopwatch context manager used by every writer.
- **Live writer test** (`tests/test_writers_live.py`) double-gated by `OPNSENSE_LAB_*` env + `OPNSENSE_ALLOW_WRITE=1`. Auto-skips if the host running pytest can't reach the lab (mgmt-network requirement). Performs a full `create → search → delete` cycle with cleanup in `finally`.

### Verified live
- Manual end-to-end cycle from `pve3` against the lab `https://190.160.10.108`:
  - `addItem` → `{result: saved, uuid: a58717cc-...}`
  - `reconfigure` → `{status: ok}`
  - `delItem/{uuid}` → `{result: deleted}`
  - `reconfigure` → `{status: ok}`
- `pf` is force-disabled after each reconfigure to keep the lab reachable from the dev workstation; this is lab-only and noted in the SOPS entry.

### Changed
- `manifest.json`: 0.5.0 → 0.6.0.
- `src/writers/__init__.py`: re-exports `AliasInput/AliasWriter`, `RuleInput/RuleWriter`, `AuditLog/AuditEntry`, `HAVerifier`.

### QA gate
- `ruff check src tests` → clean.
- `pytest` → **68 passed, 16 skipped** (live writer test counts as 1 of the skipped ones unless `OPNSENSE_ALLOW_WRITE=1` and lab reachable).
- 16 new unit tests cover happy path, missing uuid, reconfigure-failure rollback, validation rejections, audit append/tail/corrupt-line tolerance, HA verifier single-node + matching peer + diverging peer.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Route layer** (`src/routes/overview.py`): `build_overview(client)` returns one JSON snapshot covering system, interfaces, gateways, services, VPN (WG/IPsec/OpenVPN aggregate), HA sync, and certs (with a 30-day expiring filter). `build_overview_payload(host)` wraps it with auth/timeout/upstream error envelopes.
- **Plugin entry point** wires three Flask routes via `register_plugin_route`:
  - `GET /api/health` (config sanity)
  - `GET /api/ui` (the static dashboard)
  - `GET /api/overview` (the aggregated payload)
  - Plus `_first_host_from_config()` helper that materializes an `OPNsenseHost` from `config.json`.
- **Industrial-brutalist Overview UI** (`opnsense.html`) built through the mandatory UI chain (`ui-ux-pro-max` → `emil-design-eng` → `design-taste-frontend` → `high-end-visual-design` → `impeccable craft` → `industrial-brutalist-ui`):
  - Tactical Telemetry palette: `#0a0a0a` substrate, `#eaeaea` foreground, `#e61919` lone accent, `#4af626` reserved for the HA-active chip.
  - System fonts only (`ui-monospace`, `ui-sans-serif`) — no web font fetch.
  - Hard 90° corners, 1px CSS-grid dividers, ASCII-bracketed `[ SECTION ]` headers, `///` separators.
  - 12-column grid that collapses cleanly to 6 cols at 1024px and a single column at 768px.
  - Cells: System (CPU/MEM/PF meters), HA Sync, Certs, Interfaces table (RX/TX/err/drop), Gateways table (RTT/loss), Services running ratio, VPN aggregate.
  - Auto-refresh every 30s, manual refresh button (`active:translateY(1px)`, ARIA-labelled, busy-state).
  - A11y: `role="banner"`/`role="alert"`, `aria-busy`, `aria-live` on connection status, table `<caption class="vh">` for screen readers, focus rings, color is never the only signal.
  - `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` cancels skeleton shimmer + all transitions.
- **Tests**:
  - `tests/test_routes_unit.py` — 12 cases covering aggregation shape, certs filter, ok/auth/upstream payload envelopes (with retry exhaustion).
  - `tests/test_ui_html.py` — 8 static checks: HTML parses, viewport + color-scheme metas present, module script wired, brutalist palette CSS variables defined, no banned AI tells (`background-clip: text`, gradient text, `border-radius` on cards), reduced-motion media query enforces `animation: none`, ARIA landmarks + busy state, responsive breakpoints at 1280/1024/768.

### Changed
- `manifest.json`: 0.4.0 → 0.5.0.
- `__init__.py`: `register()` now wires the overview blueprint and reports v0.5.0.

### QA gate
- `ruff check src tests` → clean.
- `pytest` → **52 passed, 15 skipped** (live unchanged).
- UI verified statically via the new `test_ui_html.py` suite. Live browser run deferred to v1.0 RC (needs PegaProx host with plugin installed → Playwright).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **HA collector** (`collect_hasync`) — collapses OPNsense option-group dicts (`{value, selected}`) to plain values. Surfaces `enabled`, `pfsync_interface`, `pfsync_peer_ip`, `pfsync_version`, `sync_to_ip`, `sync_compatibility`, `sync_disable_preempt`, `sync_disconnect_ppps`.
- **Routing/neighbor collectors** (`collect_routes`, `collect_arp`, `collect_ndp`) — system route table + IPv4/IPv6 neighbor caches with manufacturer + interface description.
- **Firewall log tail** (`collect_firewall_log(limit=N)`) — projects 10 useful fields out of OPNsense's 26-field rows. Defaults to 100 entries; uses query-string limit so the full bulky payload stays on the wire.
- **VPN collectors** (`collect_wireguard`, `collect_ipsec`, `collect_openvpn`, plus aggregator `collect_vpn`) — uniform `VPNPeer` shape across the three engines, retains raw OPNsense row for UI deep-dive.
- **Fixtures** added (8 new): `getRoutes`, `getArp`, `getNdp`, `firewall_log` (slimmed to 5 entries), `firewall_log_filters`, `ipsec_searchPhase1`, `openvpn_searchSessions`, `wireguard_general_get`.

### Changed
- `manifest.json`: 0.3.0 → 0.4.0.
- `src/collectors/__init__.py`: re-exports new types and functions.

### QA gate
- `ruff check src tests` → clean.
- Unit suite: **32 passed, 15 skipped** (live).
- Live suite (with SOPS-decrypted creds): **15 passed in 12.02s** vs `https://190.160.10.108`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Read-only collectors** (`src/collectors/`):
  - `collect_system` — version banner, CPU type, uptime/load, memory used/total + ARC, pf states current/limit/% utilization. Tolerates `cpu_usage/getCPUType` failure.
  - `collect_interfaces` — merges `getInterfaceConfig` + `getInterfaceStatistics` into one snapshot per iface (mac, flags, IPv4/IPv6 addrs, mtu, rx/tx bytes/packets/errors/drops/collisions, `is_up` derived from flags). Parses OPNsense's `[LABEL] (iface)` stat-key format.
  - `collect_gateways` — name/address/monitor/status, delay/loss/stddev coerced from `~` and `12.3 ms`/`0.0 %` strings to floats. `is_up` derived from `status_translated == "Online"`.
  - `collect_services` — running/stopped count + per-service `(id, name, description, running, locked)`.
  - `collect_certificates` — metadata only (PEM payloads dropped on purpose), with `days_to_expiry` parsed from `valid_to`.
- **Live fixtures** in `fixtures/live/` (12 captured responses from the OPNsense 26.1.2 lab) with cert PEM/private key payloads redacted (`<CRT_REDACTED>`, `<PRV_REDACTED>`, etc.).
- **Tests**: 5 unit tests in `tests/test_collectors_unit.py` (fixture-driven, mocked with `responses`). 5 live smoke tests in `tests/test_collectors_live.py` gated by `OPNSENSE_LAB_*` env vars. All green against the lab.

### Changed
- `manifest.json`: `version` 0.2.0 → 0.3.0.

### QA gate
- `ruff check src tests` → clean.
- `pytest -q` → **22 passed, 6 skipped** (live skipped without env).
- Live run with SOPS-decrypted creds → **6 passed in 4.92s** against `https://190.160.10.108`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **`OPNsenseClient`** (`src/client/opnsense_client.py`): real HTTP client. HTTPS-only, `HTTPBasicAuth(api_key, api_secret)`, configurable connect/read timeouts, retry-with-exponential-backoff on idempotent GETs (3 attempts, 5xx 502/503/504 + connection errors), POST is never retried (callers own reconcile/rollback). Public sugar methods `system_information()` and `hasync_get()`.
- **Typed exception ladder**: `OPNsenseError` / `OPNsenseAuthError` (401/403) / `OPNsenseTimeoutError`.
- **`OPNsenseHost`** dataclass with `verify_tls` + optional `ca_bundle_path` for self-signed labs.
- Unit tests `tests/test_client_unit.py` (12 cases) covering happy path, 401/403, basic-auth header, GET retry on 502/503, no retry on POST, connection-error exhaustion, http URL rejection, non-JSON response, path normalisation. Uses `responses` library — zero network.
- Live smoke `tests/test_client_live.py` against the lab, gated by `OPNSENSE_LAB_URL`/`KEY`/`SECRET` env vars (auto-skip when unset).
- Plugin `__init__.py` now imports PegaProx framework defensively (`try/except ImportError`) so the package is importable in test/lint environments without PegaProx installed.

### Changed
- `manifest.json`: `version` 0.1.0 → 0.2.0.
- `requirements-dev.txt`: pinned `requests>=2.31`, `responses>=0.24` (already present, just exercised now).

### QA gate
- `ruff check src tests` → all checks passed.
- `pytest` → 17 passed, 1 skipped (live, runs when env vars are set).
- Live smoke against lab `https://190.160.10.108` (OPNsense 26.1.2_5) → HTTP 200 / ~120 ms.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-09
